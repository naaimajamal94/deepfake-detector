# AI Image Authenticity Checker

This project provides a web-based application that allows users to upload an image and receive a probabilistic assessment of whether the image is real or AI-generated.

## Purpose
The tool is designed for educational and personal awareness purposes. It aims to help users identify AI-generated images that may be used for misinformation or misuse.

## How It Works
- Users upload an image through the web interface.
- The system analyzes technical image patterns associated with AI generation.
- A confidence score is displayed indicating whether the image is likely real or AI-generated.

## Privacy
- Uploaded images are processed temporarily in memory.
- Images are not stored, logged, or shared.
- The system does not retain user data.

## Limitations
- The tool provides probabilistic results and is not definitive proof.
- It may not reliably detect face-swapped or video-based deepfakes.
- Performance may vary across image quality and generation methods.

## Ethical Use
This project intentionally avoids the use of explicit or non-consensual imagery and focuses on detection of AI-generated content rather than image semantics.

## Disclaimer
This tool is provided for research and educational purposes only and should not be used as legal evidence.
